## A simple Weather application

**Built in Swift as a school project**

Most of the implemented features were built to prove my ability to work with Swift, such as the navigation slider at the bottom of the screen.
THe visual presentation is far from what I would release if the application was to be up to my standards.



Visual presentation below:
